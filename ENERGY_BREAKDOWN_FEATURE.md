- ✅ Future forecast for all 3 types (dashed lines, bold)
- ✅ Smart aggregation (daily for 30 days, monthly for longer)
- ✅ Markers for monthly views
- ✅ Clear legends with emojis

## 📈 How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Forecast Tab

1. Select your city (e.g., Vancouver, British Columbia)
2. Click on the **🔮 Forecast** tab

### Step 2: View Two Graphs

**Graph 1**: Overall Renewable Energy Score

- Shows Prophet, XGBoost, and Ensemble forecasts
- Combined score of all energy types

**Graph 2**: Energy Type Breakdown ⭐ NEW!

- Shows Solar, Wind, and Hydro separately
- Understand which energy type performs best

### Step 3: Change Forecast Horizon

- **30 days**: See daily variations for each type
- **4 months**: See monthly averages (4 clear points per type)
- **1 year**: See annual trend (12 points per type)

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Investment Decisions

**Question**: "Should I invest in solar or wind?"

**Answer**: Look at the forecast lines:

- If **orange** (solar) is consistently high → Solar investment
- If **blue** (wind) is consistently high → Wind investment
- If both are high → Hybrid system!

### 2. Seasonal Planning

**Question**: "Which energy source is best in winter?"

**Answer**: Check December-February months:

- High **teal** (hydro) → Good rainfall/snow
- High **blue** (wind) → Strong winter winds
- Low **orange** (solar) → Less sunlight

### 3. Portfolio Diversification

**Question**: "How diverse is this location's renewable potential?"

**Answer**: Look at line separation:

- Lines far apart → Diverse potential
- Lines close together → Similar performance
- One line much higher → Dominant source

## 📊 Example Interpretation

### Vancouver, BC (1 Year Forecast)

```
☀️ Solar:  Peaks in July (0.75) | Low in December (0.35)
💨 Wind:   Steady year-round (0.50-0.60)
💧 Hydro:  High Oct-Mar (0.80) | Lower in summer (0.45)

Recommendation:
- Primary: Hydro (consistent high performance)
- Secondary: Wind (stable backup)
- Supplemental: Solar (summer peak)
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Train separate Prophet models** for each energy type
2. **Generate individual forecasts** (Solar, Wind, Hydro)
3. **Aggregate if needed** (monthly for long horizons)
4. **Plot all 6 lines** (3 historical + 3 forecast)

### Performance

- Training time: ~5-10 seconds (3 models)
- Uses Streamlit caching (subsequent views are instant)
- Aggregation makes long-term forecasts readable

---

## 📝 Graph Sections

### Historical Section (Left Side)

- Last 90 days of data
- Three semi-transparent solid lines
- Shows recent performance

### Forecast Section (Right Side)

- Future predictions
- Three bold dashed lines
- Shows expected performance

### Transition Point

- Clear visual break
- Historical ends where forecast begins
- Easy to distinguish

---

## 🎓 Reading the Graph

### High Values (0.7 - 1.0)

- **Solar**: Lots of sun, minimal cloud cover
- **Wind**: Strong consistent winds
- **Hydro**: Heavy rainfall/snowmelt

### Medium Values (0.4 - 0.7)

- **Solar**: Partly cloudy conditions
- **Wind**: Moderate wind speeds
- **Hydro**: Normal precipitation

### Low Values (0.0 - 0.4)

- **Solar**: Cloudy/winter months
- **Wind**: Calm conditions
- **Hydro**: Dry periods

## 🚀 Demo Tips

### For Hackathon Judges:

1. Show **Vancouver** for diverse data
2. Select **1 year** forecast
3. Point out:
   - "Orange line shows solar peaks in summer"
   - "Teal line shows hydro peaks with rainfall"
   - "Blue line shows steady wind all year"
4. Emphasize: "This helps plan renewable energy mix"

### Key Talking Points:

- ✅ "Separate forecasts for each energy type"
- ✅ "AI predicts optimal energy source per season"
- ✅ "Supports diversified energy portfolio planning"
- ✅ "Clear visualization for non-technical stakeholders"
