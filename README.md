# 🌤️ ClimaZoneAI – Smart Energy Planning with AI

## 🔍 Overview
ClimaZoneAI is an AI tool that helps industries and governments make smarter energy decisions.  
It uses Canadian weather data to **predict how much renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro)** will be available in different regions and at different times of the year.  
This helps companies **plan when to run machines** and **where to set up factories** to save money and reduce pollution.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem
Many factories in Canada use electricity at fixed times — even when renewable energy is low and grid power is expensive.  
At the same time, high energy costs make **local manufacturing less competitive**, so Canada imports many goods from abroad.  

ClimaZoneAI solves this by helping companies **know when and where renewable energy is strongest** so they can plan smarter and cheaper production.

## 💡 The Solution
ClimaZoneAI combines **weather data** and **AI forecasting** to:
1. Predict renewable energy potential by region and season.  
2. Recommend the best times to run power-hungry equipment.  
3. Show renewable availability on an **interactive map and dashboard**.  
4. Help governments and industries find **ideal zones** for clean manufacturing.

## 🌐 Dataset
- **Source:** Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)
- **Data Includes:** temperature, precipitation, snow, wind speed
- **Regions Covered:** Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Winnipeg, Quebec City, and more  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Clean the data** – fix missing values and scale units.  
2. **Calculate renewable scores** – Solar, Wind, and Hydro indices.  
3. **Forecast future energy** using AI models like Prophet or Regression.  
4. **Visualize results** on a map and dashboard built with Python tools (Plotly, Streamlit, Folium).  
5. **Generate insights** – where and when companies can lower costs and use more renewables.

## 📊 Example Insights

| Region | Main Renewable | Best Months | Suggestion |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Vancouver | Hydro + Wind | Nov–Apr | Good for water-cooled industries |
| Calgary | Solar | May–Sep | Works well for solar-driven manufacturing |
| Winnipeg | Wind | Oct–Feb | Great for turbine components |
| Quebec City | Hydro | Year-round | Suited for battery and clean-tech plants |

## 💰 Benefits
- Save **10–20% on electricity costs**  
- Support **local manufacturing** (less dependence on imports)  
- Cut **carbon emissions** through cleaner energy use  
- Help **planners identify renewable-rich industrial zones**

---

## 🧭 Deliverables
- Interactive AI dashboard  
- Canada renewable map  
- City-level case study (e.g., Vancouver)  
- AI forecasting scripts  
- Short final presentation
