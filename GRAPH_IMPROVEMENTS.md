## 🔧 Technical Details

### Aggregation Logic

```
IF forecast_days <= 30:
    → Show daily data (no aggregation)

ELSE IF forecast_days <= 150:
    → Aggregate to monthly averages (4-5 months)

ELSE:
    → Aggregate to monthly averages (12 months)
```

### How Monthly Aggregation Works

1. Group predictions by calendar month
2. Calculate mean forecast value for each month
3. Use first day of month as the date marker
4. Apply to all three models consistently

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### In the Dashboard:

1. **Select your city** (left sidebar)

   - Province: British Columbia
   - City: Vancouver (recommended for complete data)

2. **Choose forecast horizon**:

   - 30 days (1 month) → Daily view
   - 120 days (4 months) → Monthly view
   - 365 days (1 year) → Monthly view

3. **Forecast Tab** will show:
   - Smart aggregated visualization
   - All three models
   - Clear, readable charts
   - Annotation explaining the view

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### XGBoost Training Error - FIXED ✅

**Issue**: `XGBModel.fit() got an unexpected keyword argument 'eval_metric'`

**Solution**: Updated for XGBoost 3.x compatibility

- Removed deprecated `eval_metric` parameter
- Removed `eval_set` parameter
- Training now works smoothly

---

## 📊 Example: 4 Months View

Instead of seeing 120 cluttered daily points:

```
❌ Before: 120 data points (hard to read)
```

You now see:

```
✅ After: 4 monthly points (clear trend)
January → 0.67
February → 0.71
March → 0.69
April → 0.73
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

For **Hackathon demos**:

- Use **Vancouver** (complete data)
- Show **30 days** for detailed analysis
- Show **1 year** for long-term strategy
- Highlight the **Ensemble model** (green line)
